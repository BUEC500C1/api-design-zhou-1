For all USA Airports, Develop an API and module where we can get current conditions for the airport asked by the API and we can get current weather graphs for specific period

<hr>   

Here, I created three functions in weatherAPI.py, one for searching weather information based on city name, one for getting latitude and longitude information from airport's name based on csv file, last one for searching weather based on latitude and longitude.

Anyone interested in this project are encouraged to change the name in my two test python files to see the results.
